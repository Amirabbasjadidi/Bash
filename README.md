# ClickCount
ClickCount is an easy project built using Python and the Flask library. This project, which is essentially a website, can count the number of times you click the button in the middle of the page. Each time you click the button, it plays a pre-recorded sound.

You can test this code on the website [mrbarzegharbash](https://mrbarzegharbash.iran.liara.run/), which is entirely built using these codes.

Don't forget, if you intend to use this code in a language other than Persian or right-to-left languages, change the
```
body {
  direction: rtl;
}
```
in the static/style.css file to 
```
body {
  direction: ltr;
}
```
